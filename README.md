# A demo TicTacToe game

## How to run the application

The easiest way would be to open app/index.html directly in browser.

However there is a possibility to serve the files via http server.

To use the server, you will need to install Node -- you can do this via the
[download page](https://nodejs.org/download/) or using
[Homebrew](http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/) if you are on a Mac.

You can clone or download this repo. Once you have done so, from the root
directory of the repo, run:

    npm install
    npm start

You can then view the application in your browser at
[http://localhost:8000/app](http://localhost:8000/app).
